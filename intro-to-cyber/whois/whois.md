It should give you a lot of information about google such as companies that are hosting their website. One thing that I would like you to look at particularly is the creation date. Scroll up a little bit until you see `Creation Date` it should say there the creation date was `1997-09-15T04:00:00Z`. Now I would like you to open your browser and type in when was google first used it should say the domain was registered on September 15th 1997. Hackers can use information like this to research and gather information to execute a successful hack.
Try any websites on your own now and see what information you can find about that domain.
