It should give you a lot of information about `google`, such as companies that are hosting their website, the name servers that are used to host the website.  

One thing that I would like you to look at particularly is the creation date. Scroll up a little bit until you see `Creation Date` it should say there the creation date was `1997-09-15T04:00:00Z`.  

Now I would like you to open your browser and type in when was google first used it should say the domain was registered on September 15th 1997.  

Hackers can use information like this to research and gather information to execute a successful hack.      

Now try any websites address on your own now and see what information you can find about that domain.
