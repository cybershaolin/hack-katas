In this course you will learn about Hacking Secrets (private information) such as cracking passwords or finding hidden data in images (steganography) etc. These are ways of exploiting confidentiality.

The main tool we will be using is a tool known as John the Ripper (JTR). The way JTR works is it scans a wordlist and hashes each word in the list checking against another file with the password or the passwords hash, if the hash values match then you now that that is the password.

We will also be using Steghide which will find hidden data in images when given the correct password.

The purpose of this course is to learn how to exploit confidential (secrets) and private information so you can protect yourself against hackers stealing your information
