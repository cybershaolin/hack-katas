In this scenario you will be learning about a basic command, in linux.  

The way we will be running this commands is through an interface known as terminal it runs commands without a graphical user interface (GUI). GUI's help the user use a computer systems interface. Some examples of GUI's is file explorer, settings etc these all interact with the computer to perform a certain function.  

Hackers usually use different forms of terminals to hack, so they can send specific commands to the computer.
