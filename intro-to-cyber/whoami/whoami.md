The "whoami" command is a very basic command that is used to see who the current user is logged in.
This maybe your first command in a linux operating system so enjoy.
Type in `whoami`{{execute}}
The computer should print out the use who is logged in and it is usually your `username` or `root` because it is the default user. In our case, the logged in user account is a student account and so you are likely to see `cybershaolin_student`.
