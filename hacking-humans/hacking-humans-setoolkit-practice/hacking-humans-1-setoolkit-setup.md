__setoolkit Setup__

In the previous lessons you learned about what phishing is. In this lesson, we will use a tool called setoolkit to create (clone) a website and use that fake cloned website to harvest  username and passwords (credentials).  

Normally, the first thing we will do is to start the setoolkit program, which you can do  by typing './setoolkit' within the 'set' folder, in a hacker distro. But we have already done this for you.  

You should see a list of different options that you can select from.  

Since we are going to be tricking the user into giving secretive information. We are going to be performing a `Social Engineering Attack`. Select option number `1`{{execute}}.    

Next choose the `Website Attack Vectors` option since we will clone a real website and use the fake cloned website to trick someone. Select option number  `2`{{execute}}.      

Using that fake cloned website, we will  attempt to steal an unsuspecting (phished) use of their username and password (or credentials). So we will choose the `Credential Harvesting` attack type, which is option number `3`{{execute}}.    

We will be creating a website that looks and seems exactly like another website. In other words we will clone a real website. Select the `Site Cloner` option, which is option number  `2`{{execute}}.  

Go to the next step.
