Now you should be prompted for a URL (website) to clone. Type in `https://www.facebook.com/login`{{execute}} and press the `enter` or `return` key. This is the website we will be cloning.  

You will see a message as shown below:
```
[*] Cloning the website:
https://login.facebook.com/login.php
[*] This could take a little bit...

The best way to use this attack is if username and password form fields are available. Regardless, this captures all POSTs on a website.

[*] You may need to copy /var/www/* into /var/www/html depending on where your directory structure is.
Press {return} if you understand what we're saying here.
```   

Press the `enter` or `return` key to continue.  

Go to the next step.
