__Start Webserver__

You will see a message like `[*] Apache is set to ON - everything will be placed in your web root directory of apache.
[*] Files will be written out to the root directory of apache.
[*] ALL files are within your Apache directory since you specified it to ON.
[!] Apache may be not running, do you want SET to start the process? [y/n]:`  

Press `y`{{execute}} to start the `Apache` web server.  

Now you will see the following message `Apache webserver is set to ON. Copying over PHP file to the website.
Please note that all output from the harvester will be found under apache_dir/harvester_date.txt
Feel free to customize post.php in the /var/www/html directory
[*] All files have been copied to /var/www/html
[*] SET is now listening for incoming credentials. You can control-c out of this and completely exit SET at anytime and still keep the attack going.
[*] All files are located under the Apache web root directory: /var/www/html
[*] All fields captures will be displayed below.
[Credential Harvester is now listening below...]`  

Leave the credential harvester running for now. We will come back to this later.  

Go to the next step.
