To read the contents of the harvester file, we can use the `cat` command.   

`cat` the harvester file that was created with the timestamp when you conducted the credential harvested attack. It will usually the one with the latest timestamp.
`Example: cat harvester_2020-01-11 21:39:55.714597.txt`

Once you `cat` that file, you should see in it the credentials that were logged (as shown below).
`(
    [UserName] => CyberShaolin
    [Password] => cyb3rn1nja
    [Area] =>
    [Controller] =>
    [Action] =>
    [Tab] =>
    [Id] =>
)`
