Now, generally the hacker (you) will send a phishing email to a target user telling them to check out a cool new post/tweet and give them the URL of the website that is cloned. Some will even go to the extent of masking the IP or the URL link so that the link looks legitimate. For time purposes, we won't do this. Normally most people would click on it, especially if they trust you.  

Now think of yourself as the one receiving the phishing email and you clicked on the link.

To simulate this, click on the tab that reads `Hacker Website` (this will be the phishing website that a real user would get redirected to when they click on the phishing link). It will open up the page and show the cloned (fake) website. You should see the fake website looks like the website that was cloned.

Type in a `username` and `password`. It can be anything. For example you can use `CyberShaolin` for the username and `cyb3rn1nja` for the password. It is advisable that for this learning purposes, you do NOT use your real twitter account username and/or password. Click on the button that says `Login`.  

Go to the next step.
