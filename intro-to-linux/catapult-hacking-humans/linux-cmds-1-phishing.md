In the previous lessons you learned about what phishing is. This lesson will use a tool called setoolkit to create a fake cloned website and harvest their credentials.

The first thing we are going to do is start setoolkit you can do this by typing `setoolkit` {{execute}}  

You should see a list of different options we can choose from.  

Since we are going to be tricking the user into giving secretive information of theirs away. We are going to be executing a `Social Engineering Attack` or option number `1` {{execute}}.  

Because we are creating a fake cloned website we will select the `Website Attack Vectors` option type `2`{{execute}}.  

We are going to be stealing the victims username and password otherwise known as `Credential Harvesting` type option number `3`{{execute}}.  

We will be creating a site that looks and seems exactly like another website. Select the `Site Cloner` choice number `2`{{execute}}.  

__IP Address__
The IP address also known as the internet protocol address is a unique series of numbers that shows your device is either a host network or connected to a host network so you can browse and search the internet. Our computer is provided this IP address by the router and internet network we are connected to.  

The reason why we need to type in our IP address in setoolkit is because when the user types in their credentials and the username and password have been stolen the faked cloned website needs to send the credentials back to our computer. The only way to do that is by using our unique internet protocol identifier (IP address).
