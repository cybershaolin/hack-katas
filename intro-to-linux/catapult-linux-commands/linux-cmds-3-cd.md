__cd and ../(DotDotSlash))__  
In order to go to the previous folder, you can use the shortform `../` (DotDotSlash) along with the `cd` command.  
Since you are in the `cybershaolin` directory now, you can go to the previous directory using the `cd ../` command.

Type `cd ../`{{execute}} and press enter and you will find yourself back at the `/` directory.
