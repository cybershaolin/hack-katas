You are special agent Bourne working for the CIA (CyberShaolin Intelligence Agency).  

Your job is to find out when a cyber attack is being planned by a suspect only known by the alias The Duke. We have found out that Duke infiltrated our systems. All communications are protected using passwords, encoding, or other crypto mechanisms. Please see the `DEBREIF.msg` in the `/home` directory for more information.

Best wishes Agent Bourne.
