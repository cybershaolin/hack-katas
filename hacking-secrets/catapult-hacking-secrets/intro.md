In this course you will learn about Hacking Secrets (private information) such as cracking passwords or finding hidden data in images (steganography) etc. These are ways of exploiting confidentiality. These are generally known as 'disclosure' hacks or attacks.

The main tool we will be using is a tool known as John the Ripper (JTR). The way JTR works takes the hash value of a password and compares it against a wordlist that has hashes already computers. If the hash values match, then it displays and shows you that the password match has been found and shows you the password.

We will also be using another tool called steghide which will help us find hidden data in images and other types of media.

The purpose of this course is to learn how to exploit confidential (secrets) and private information so you know how hackers steal secrets and you will know how to better protect yourself against hackers who are looking to steal your information.
